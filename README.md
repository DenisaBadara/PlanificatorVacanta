VacationPlanner is a comprehensive web application built with MySQL, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf, featuring CSS and HTML for an intuitive user interface. Users can register or log in to access a paginated list of available vacations displayed in a table format, showing destination name, start and end dates, and total budget for each destination. The system offers various search and sorting options, including searching for destinations by country name, sorting vacations alphabetically by country, or arranging them based on budget. A key feature is the budget-based filtering system, allowing users to input minimum and maximum budget values to narrow down their options. Each vacation includes associated activities with detailed descriptions, costs, and current status (planned, in progress, or completed). The application provides full functionality for managing both vacations and activities, with dedicated buttons for adding, editing, and deleting entries. These operations are synchronized with the database in real-time, ensuring up-to-date information for all users. The system incorporates robust input validation mechanisms for names, dates, and costs. Notable features include automatic calculation of total activity costs for each vacation, prevention of adding activities exceeding the allocated budget, display of success messages after performing actions, and pagination with a maximum of 5 vacations per page. VacationPlanner includes a login page for user authentication, utilizing user data stored in the MySQL database. The application's architecture is organized into several packages, including Controllers, Models, Repositories, and Services, each handling specific functionalities of the system. This travel management system offers an efficient way for users to explore, plan, and customize their vacation experiences while maintaining budget constraints and offering a wide array of activities at each destination.
