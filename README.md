VacationPlanner is a web application built with MySQL, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf, featuring CSS and HTML for the user interface. 
Users can register or log in to access a list of available vacations displayed across multiple pages. The system allows users to search for vacations by country name, sort them alphabetically or by budget, and filter based on budget range. 
Each vacation includes a list of associated activities. Both vacations and activities can be added, edited, or deleted, with changes reflected in real-time in the database. The application calculates the total cost of activities and prevents adding new ones if they exceed the vacation budget. 
Input validations ensure proper data entry for names, dates, and costs. 
This comprehensive system provides an efficient way for users to explore and plan their ideal vacations while managing activities and staying within budget constraints.
